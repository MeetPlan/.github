# MeetPlan
MeetPlan is a student information system (shortly SIS). It's fully open-source, extremely customizable, with [backend](https://github.com/MeetPlan/MeetPlanBackend) written in Go & [frontend](https://github.com/MeetPlan/MeetPlanFrontend) in Svelte. Deployment is extremely easy using [Docker](https://github.com/MeetPlan/MeetPlanDocker).

We have some really powerful tools, such as documentation exports (certificates of ending grades, certificates of schooling), meal ordering and much more. Try it, you won't regret it (though it's only in Slovenian, which is a problem...).
