## Slovenščina
MeetPlan je študentski informacijski sistem (angl. student information system - SIS). Je popolnoma odprtokoden, zelo razširljiv, fleksibilen in primeren za vsako šolo. [Zaledni del (backend)](https://github.com/MeetPlan/MeetPlanBackend) je napisan v Go-ju, medtem ko je [spletna stran](https://github.com/MeetPlan/MeetPlanFrontend) napisana s Svelte frameworkom. Namestitev na strežnik je zelo preprosta z uporabo [Docker](https://github.com/MeetPlan/MeetPlanDocker) orodij. Poleg vsega, pa uporabljamo tudi svojo knjižico, katero imenujemo tudi Proton, ki skrbi za organizacijo nadomeščanj in vam bo zelo kmalu tudi ustvarila urnik.

Imamo kar nekaj zmogljivih orodij, med drugim tudi izvoz dokumentacije (spričevala, potrdilo o šolanju), naročanje šolske prehrane in še veliko drugega. Poskusite sistem - ne boste obžalovali.

MeetPlan sistem je zelo dobro dokumentiran s [spletno dokumentacijo](https://meetplan.si), ki vam zelo olajša delo pri namestitvi sistema na strežnik, pomaga vam pa tudi s funkcijami v sistemu, zato je zelo priporočljivo, da si jo ogledate.

## English

MeetPlan is a student information system (shortly SIS). It's fully open-source, extremely customizable, with [backend](https://github.com/MeetPlan/MeetPlanBackend) written in Go & [frontend](https://github.com/MeetPlan/MeetPlanFrontend) in Svelte. Deployment is extremely easy using [Docker](https://github.com/MeetPlan/MeetPlanDocker). It uses our internal library, called Proton, which is a fully open-source library, that manages your substitutions & soon even creates timetables for you.

We have some really powerful tools, such as documentation exports (certificates of ending grades, certificates of schooling), meal ordering and much more. Try it, you won't regret it (though it's only in Slovenian, which I agree, is a problem, but this system is currently targeted at Slovenian audience & schools).

MeetPlan is very well documented with an [online documentation](https://meetplan.si) (only in Slovenian), which makes installation of the system onto a server very easy, aswell as helps you with other functions in the system, so it's highly recommended to check it out.
